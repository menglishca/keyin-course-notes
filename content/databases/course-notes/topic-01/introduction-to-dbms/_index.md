title: 2. Introduction to DBMS

## What is a DBMS?
- A DBMS (Database Management System) is a piece of software to help you manage and interact with a database
- The DBMS is what provides the tools to add new data and retrieve old data from an existing database
- By providing the tools to work with the database, the DBMS inadvertently also provides the controls to ensure data integrity in a database
- Some common examples of a DBMS are: MySQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB and PostgreSQL

## What's the difference between a database and a DBMS?
- Commonly, you'll hear the terms thrown around almost interchangably
- For the most part, practically speaking, differentiating between the two doesn't really matter.
- The major difference is that the DBMS is the software you interact with to work with your database
- The database is really just the stored, structured data itself

## Example of a DBMS
- Thinking back to our filing cabinet example from before, how would a DBMS work for that database?
- Think of the DBMS as the filing clerk who manages the filing cabinet
  - **Organizing Files**: The filing clerk organizes and labels the folders in an orderly manner so they are easy to find.
  - **Retrieving Information**: When you need to find a student's grades or a teacherâ€™s schedule, the clerk retrieves the correct files.
  - **Updating Records**: The clerk updates the files with new information, such as adding new grades or updating contact details.
  - **Ensuring Accuracy**: The clerk ensures that each file is correctly placed and that no information is lost or misfiled.

## Why do we need a DBMS?
- Like our clerk, we need a DBMS to make it easier for us to access our data
- A DBMS controls what data our database can have, how the data must be entered and provides us with a way to work with the data in a (relatively) convenient way

## How will we handle DBMS and Databases in this course?
- To be clear, even though there is a difference between the two, we won't be differentiating much after this lecture
- Due to how intertwined the two have become, people have been referring to their DBMS as their database for years
- Practically, the differences between the two aren't overly important so we won't be stressing them here
