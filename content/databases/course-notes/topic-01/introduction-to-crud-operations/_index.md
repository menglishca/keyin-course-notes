## CRUD Operations
- CRUD Operations are the way we describe the four main types of interactions one will have with a database
- They are:
  - **Create**
    - Adding brand new data to a database
    - This would be adding new files to our filing cabinet
  - **Read**
    - Reading of existing data in the database
    - This would be pulling a file out of the cabinet and reading it
  - **Update**
    - Modifying (or updating) existing data in the database
    - This would be changing the information on one of the files in our filing cabinet
  - **Delete**
    - Deleting existing data in the database
    - This would be taking a folder out of our filing cabinet and throwing it away

- CRUD is an important acronym because it represents the main operations we'll be doing with a database
- Even though the interactions might seem more complicated, to some degree most operations boil down to some form of CRUD
- Each DBMS provides their own way for performing these operations
