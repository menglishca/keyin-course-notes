  You are tasked with building a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application that connects to a **PostgreSQL** database and allows the user to manage a simple list of items. Your app should be able to:

  1. **Create a table** in the database for storing item information if it doesn't already exist.
  2. **Insert a new item** into the table by passing the item name as a command-line argument.
  3. **Display all items** stored in the table.

  ### Functional Requirements:

  - The database should have a table called `items` with two columns:
    - `id` (integer): The primary key, which auto-increments.
    - `name` (text): The name of the item.
  
  - The CLI should support two commands:
    1. `insert <item_name>`: Inserts an item with the provided name into the database.
    2. `show`: Displays all the items currently stored in the table.

1. **Setting up the database connection**:
    - Use the `pg` npm package to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
    - The connection details (username, password, etc.) should be set up in the script.
    
2. **Creating the `items` table**:
    - Before any data can be inserted, the script should ensure the table exists.
    - Use the SQL statement `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` to create the table if it doesn't already exist.
    
3. **Inserting data**:
    - When the user runs the command `insert <item_name>`, the script should take the item name from the command-line argument and insert it into the `items` table.
    - Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.
    
4. **Displaying all data**:
    - When the user runs the command `show`, the script should query the `items` table and display all the rows (showing the `id` and `name` of each item).

    <summary><h3 style="display: inline-flex; margin-top: 10px;">Input/Output Examples</h3></summary>

- **Inserting an item**:
  - Command:
    ```bash
    node index.js insert "Apple"
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    Inserted item: Apple
    ```

- **Displaying all items**:
  - Command:
    ```bash
    node index.js show
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    Items in the table:
    1: Apple
    2: Orange
    ```

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3 style="display: inline-flex; margin-top: 10px;">Additional Instructions</h3></summary>

  - Ensure that the database connection is properly closed after each command to avoid hanging processes.
  - Handle any errors that might occur during the database connection or query execution and provide meaningful error messages to the user.
  - Use parameterized queries when inserting data to prevent SQL injection attacks.

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3 style="display: inline-flex; margin-top: 10px;">Hint</h3></summary>

  - For PostgreSQL interaction, the `pg` library will be used. Make sure to install it using:
    ```bash
    npm install pg
    ```
  - You'll need to pass arguments from the command line, which can be accessed via `process.argv` in Node.js.
  - Make sure to test both commands (`insert` and `show`) to verify that your application works correctly.

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3 style="display: inline-flex; margin-top: 10px;">Bonus Task</h3></summary>

  - Add a command to **delete** all items from the `items` table, giving users a way to clear the list.
  - Command: `node index.js clear`

  You are tasked with building a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application that connects to a **PostgreSQL** database and allows users to manage a to-do list. Your app should be able to:

  1. **Create a table** in the database for storing to-do items if it doesn't already exist.
  2. **Insert a new to-do item** into the table via command-line arguments.
  3. **Display all to-do items** stored in the table.
  4. **Mark a to-do item as completed** by its ID.
  5. **Delete a to-do item** by its ID.

  ### Functional Requirements:

  - The database should have a table called `todos` with the following columns:
    - `id` (serial primary key): The unique identifier for each to-do item.
    - `task` (text): The description of the to-do item.
    - `completed` (boolean): Indicates whether the item has been completed (default is `false`).
  
  - The CLI should support the following commands:
    1. `add <task>`: Adds a new to-do item with the provided task description.
    2. `show`: Displays all to-do items along with their IDs and completion status.
    3. `complete <id>`: Marks the to-do item with the given ID as completed.
    4. `delete <id>`: Deletes the to-do item with the specified ID.

1. **Setting up the database connection**:
    - Use the `pg` npm package to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
    - Set up the connection details (username, password, etc.) in the script.

2. **Creating the `todos` table**:
    - Ensure the `todos` table exists before any data manipulation occurs.
    - Use the SQL statement `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` to create the table.

3. **Inserting a to-do item**:
    - When the user runs the command `add <task>`, the script should take the task description from the command-line argument and insert it into the `todos` table.

4. **Displaying all to-do items**:
   - When the user runs the command `show`, the script should query the `todos` table and display all rows (showing the `id`, `task`, and `completed` status).

5. **Completing a to-do item**:
    - When the user runs the command `complete <id>`, the script should update the `completed` status of the to-do item with the given ID to `true`.

6. **Deleting a to-do item**:
    - When the user runs the command `delete <id>`, the script should remove the to-do item with the specified ID from the `todos` table.

  You are tasked with building a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application that interacts with a **PostgreSQL** database and allows users to manage a libraryâ€™s book collection. Your app should be able to:

  1. **Create a table** in the database for storing book information if it doesn't already exist.
  2. **Insert a new book record** into the table via command-line arguments.
  3. **Display all books** stored in the table.
  4. **Update book information** (like title or author) by the book's ID.
  5. **Mark a book as checked out** by its ID.
  6. **Delete a book** by its ID.
  7. **List all available books** (i.e., books that haven't been checked out).

  ### Functional Requirements:

  - The database should have a table called `books` with the following columns:
    - `id` (serial primary key): The unique identifier for each book.
    - `title` (text): The title of the book.
    - `author` (text): The author of the book.
    - `checked_out` (boolean): Indicates whether the book has been checked out (default is `false`).

  - The CLI should support the following commands:
    1. `add <title> <author>`: Adds a new book with the given title and author to the collection.
    2. `show`: Displays all books along with their IDs, titles, authors, and check-out status.
    3. `update <id> <field> <new_value>`: Updates the specified field (`title` or `author`) of the book with the given ID.
    4. `checkout <id>`: Marks the book with the given ID as checked out.
    5. `delete <id>`: Deletes the book with the specified ID.
    6. `available`: Displays all books that have not been checked out.
