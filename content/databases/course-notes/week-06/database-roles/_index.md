title: 2. Roles of a database in Backend Development
---

## Why have a database?
- Databases are critical for web development
- Mainly because databases allow you to store, retrieve and manage data for web applications
- They provide persistent data storage, so a user can come back to your site later and their data will be there waiting for them

## How do we pick the type of database?
- As we've mentioned before, there are two main types of databases:
  - Relational (SQL) databases
  - Non-relational (NoSQL) databases
- Relational databases are frequently used when the data we're working with the is structured data with complicated relationships
  - Such as e-commerce or finance data
- Non-relational databases are frequently used when the data isn't as structured or there's more real-time data
  - Such as with social media apps
- Realistically, either type of database _can_ work, if you want it to
  - They both have their advantages and disadvantages, which one you end up choosing is up to you
  - You _might_ just have to do more work to get a certain type of database to fit your use case
