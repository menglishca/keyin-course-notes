  <summary><h2 style="display: inline-flex; margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 5px;">Example 1: CLI-Based Item Manager</h2></summary>

  You are tasked with building a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application that connects to a **MongoDB** database via **Mongoose**. The application will manage a simple list of items. Your app should:

  1. **Create a table** in the database for storing item information if it doesn't already exist.
  2. **Insert a new item** into the table by passing the item name as a command-line argument.
  3. **Display all items** stored in the table.

  ### Functional Requirements:

  - The `Item` collection in MongoDB should have the following fields:
    - `_id`: The unique identifier generated automatically by MongoDB.
    - `name` (String): The name of the item.

  - The CLI should support two commands:
    1. `insert <item_name>`: Inserts an item with the provided name into the database.
    2. `show`: Displays all the items currently stored in the collection.

1. **Setting up the Mongoose connection**:
   - Use the `mongoose` package to connect to your MongoDB database.
   - Define the connection string in your script (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/items_db`).

2. **Creating the `Item` model**:
   - Define a schema using Mongoose's `Schema` class with the required fields.
   - Create a Mongoose model from the schema for interacting with the `items` collection.

3. **Inserting data**:
   - For the `insert <item_name>` command, create a new `Item` document using the Mongoose model and save it to the database.

4. **Displaying all data**:
   - For the `show` command, retrieve all documents from the `items` collection and display them in the CLI.

- **Inserting an item**:
  - Command:
    ```bash
    node index.js insert "Apple"
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    Inserted item: Apple
    ```

- **Displaying all items**:
  - Command:
    ```bash
    node index.js show
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    Items in the table:
    1: Apple
    2: Orange
    ```

  You are tasked with building a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application that connects to a **MongoDB** database via **Mongoose**. The application will manage a to-do list. Your app should:

  1. **Create a schema and model** for storing to-do items.
  2. **Insert a new to-do item** into the database via command-line arguments.
  3. **Display all to-do items** stored in the database.
  4. **Mark a to-do item as completed** by its ID.
  5. **Delete a to-do item** by its ID.

  ### Functional Requirements:

  - The `ToDo` collection should have the following fields:
    - `_id`: The unique identifier generated by MongoDB.
    - `task` (String): The description of the to-do item.
    - `completed` (Boolean): Whether the item has been completed (default: `false`).

  - The CLI should support these commands:
    1. `add <task>`: Adds a new to-do item with the provided task description.
    2. `show`: Displays all to-do items.
    3. `complete <id>`: Marks the to-do item with the given ID as completed.
    4. `delete <id>`: Deletes the to-do item with the specified ID.

    - `title` (String): The title of the book.
    - `author` (String): The author of the book.
    - `publication_year` (Number): The year the book was published.

  - The Express app should support the following endpoints:
    1. `GET /books`: Returns a list of all books.
    2. `POST /books`: Adds a new book with the provided title, author, and publication year.
    3. `PUT /books/:id`: Updates the book details for the specified ID.
    4. `GET /books/:id`: Retrieves book details for the specified ID.

   - Define a `Book` schema and model.

2. **Listing all books**:
   - Implement the `GET /books` endpoint that queries the `books` collection and returns all book documents in JSON format.

3. **Adding a new book**:
   - Implement the `POST /books` endpoint that takes book information from the request body and inserts it into the `books` collection.

4. **Updating book details**:
   - Implement the `PUT /books/:id` endpoint that updates the book document (title, author, and publication year) based on the provided book ID.

5. **Retrieving book details**:
