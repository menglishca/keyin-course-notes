title: 3. When to use NoSQL?
---

Choosing between SQL (relational) and NoSQL databases depends on the requirements of the application. NoSQL databases are ideal for specific scenarios where flexibility, scalability, and performance are critical.

## Key Use Cases for NoSQL

### 1. Applications with Rapidly Changing Requirements
- NoSQL databases provide a flexible schema, allowing you to add or modify fields without downtime.
- Suitable for agile development environments or when the application evolves frequently.
- **Example:**
  - A startup launching a new social media app can quickly adapt to changing user demands by modifying data models without worrying about rigid schema constraints.

### 2. Big Data and High-Volume Applications
- Designed to handle large-scale, unstructured, or semi-structured data.
- Optimized for distributed storage and processing across multiple servers.
- **Example:**
  - An IoT application collecting sensor data from millions of devices benefits from NoSQL's ability to scale horizontally and store diverse data formats.


### 3. Real-Time Applications
- NoSQL databases are optimized for low-latency reads and writes, enabling real-time performance.
- Common in use cases like gaming, financial transactions, or social media feeds.
- **Example:**
  - A gaming platform with real-time leaderboards and player statistics requires fast reads/writes to keep users engaged.

### 4. Hierarchical or Nested Data
- NoSQL’s document-oriented databases, like MongoDB, are well-suited for representing hierarchical data structures.
- No need for complex joins as in relational databases.
- **Example:**
  - An e-commerce application can represent products, reviews, and user data in nested JSON documents, making querying simpler and faster.

### 5. Scalability and High Availability
- Applications expecting exponential growth in users or data benefit from NoSQL’s horizontal scalability.
- Sharding and replication ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Example:**
  - A global streaming service can distribute data geographically, ensuring users in different regions experience low latency.


## Specific Situations Where NoSQL Excels
### 1. Content Management Systems (CMS)
- Flexible schema accommodates diverse content types like articles, videos, and images.
- NoSQL can efficiently store metadata and relationships between content items.

### 2. Event Logging and Analytics
- Handles high write loads for logging user activity or system events.
- NoSQL’s schema flexibility supports various log formats.
- **Example:**
  - A web analytics platform tracking user clicks and page views in real-time benefits from NoSQL’s ability to store and process large volumes of unstructured data.

## When Not to Use NoSQL
- While NoSQL is powerful, there are scenarios where it may not be the best fit:

### 1. Complex Transactions
- Relational databases excel at multi-step transactions requiring strict ACID compliance.
- NoSQL databases, while improving in this area, may not guarantee the same level of consistency.

### 2. Strongly-Structured Data
- If your application involves fixed schemas with well-defined relationships, SQL databases may be more appropriate.
- Example: A financial system requiring rigid data integrity and complex joins.

### 3. Limited Querying Needs
- NoSQL’s rich querying capabilities might be unnecessary for simple, low-volume applications.

## Key Considerations Before Choosing NoSQL
1. Data Structure Flexibility:
    - Are your data schemas likely to evolve over time?
2. Scalability Needs:
    - Do you anticipate large data volumes or high user traffic?
3. Application Requirements:
    - Does your app prioritize low-latency operations or complex relational queries?
4. Budget and Infrastructure:
    - Can you manage the complexities of distributed systems if horizontal scaling is required?
