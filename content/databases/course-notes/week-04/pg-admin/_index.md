title: 5. Working with pgAdmin
---

To reinforce some of the earlier concepts of SQL and Postgres, we'll be working through some examples using the pgAdmin tool to interact with our PostgreSQL database

## What is pgAdmin?
- pgAdmin is a graphical interface for interacting with and managing PostgreSQL databases
- You can do things like create tables, insert data, update data, etc. everything you would expect from a command line
- It also can be a little bit easier to use, depending on your preferences

## Example 1: School Enrollment System
