## What is SQL?
 - SQL (commonly pronounced as See-quel) standards for **Structured Query Language** and is the standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases
 - SQL allows you to define and manipulate the structured data you have stored in your relational databases

## Why is it important to learn?
- SQL is the standard language for use with relational databases
  - Meaning that almost all relational database management systems (i.e. MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL) all use SQL as their primary language
  - One key characteristic of the non-relational database management systems is that they don't require SQL (hence the NoSQL moniker)
- SQL is a declarative language
  - With SQL you specify what you want to achieve (such as fetching certain data) and the RDBBMS manages _how_ the task is completed
  - This means all you have to do is tell the DBMS what you want done, and the DBMS will take care of doing it
## How does SQL map to a relational database?
- SQL allows you to interact with the tables inside a relational database
- A database can have multiple tables, and you tell SQL which table you want to work with
