title: 5. Types of databases
---

- Databases have two main types we're concerned with in this course, relational and non-relational

## Relational Databases
- Get their name from their ability to link (or relate) different pieces of data together
- This is done through tables, where all data is stored in some form of table
- Then the database provides mechanisms to link those tables together

## Non-relational Databases
- Also known as NoSQL databases
- Get their name for their ability to store data in a way that doesn't require the rigid structure and relations of a relational database
- Originally designed with the cloud in mind, so they scale well across multiple servers
