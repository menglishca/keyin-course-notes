## Objective
Create a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application in Node.js that generates passwords for users based on arguments they provide via flags  
**Due Date: September 19th, 2024 at 11:59PM**

## Requirements
1. **Basic Functionality:**
   - Your CLI application should generate passwords of lowercase letters with the following features:
     - A help message, informing a user how to use the application and it's flags, which can be displayed using a standard help flag.
     - A flag to specify the length of the password.
     - If length flag is **not** provided, 8 should be used as the default password length
     - Proper handling of invalid input, with informative error messages if inputs are missing or incorrect.

2. **Customizable Features:**
    - At least **one** of the following customizable features must be implemented to provide a user with more control over the generated password:
      - A flag specifying that **numbers** should be eligible to be included in the password
      - A flag specifying that **capital letters** should be eligible to be included in the password
      - A flag specifying that **symbols** should be eligible to be included in the password
   - The customizable feature should be created on a separate branch, then merged into the main branch via a GitHub pull request

3. **Git/Code Hygiene:**
   - Use proper git hygiene throughout the project. This includes:
     - Regularly committing changes with meaningful commit messages.
     - Ensuring your email address and name are set in your git configuration.
     - Avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary files such as `.DS_Store` on macOS.
   - Ensure that code is easily readable, consistently styled and includes header comments to describe any functions you create.

4. **Package.json:**
   - Your `package.json` file must atleast include:
     - Your name.
     - The name of the app.
     - The name of the `main` file.
     - A working `bin` command to execute the application.

5. **README:**
   - Include a `README.md` file that provides:
     - The name of the app.
     - A brief description of what the app does.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submissions should be made on Teams under the appropriate assignment
- Your submission should **only** include a link to your github repository which contains the code for this QAP
- Submitting your assignment incorrectly may result in a loss of marks.

## Pass Outstanding Criteria
To achieve a pass outstanding, you **must**:
  - Meet all other requirements outlined above
  - Implement **all three** customizable features instead of just one.
    - One feature **must** still be completed on a separated branch and merged via a Github pull request
    - The other two features _can_ be committed directly to the main branch if you'd prefer, but proper git hygiene should be maintained

## Notes
  - Use of npm packages is allowed but not required. If you use any npm packages, please make sure that the `node_modules` directory is not tracked by Git and the proper package files are tracked.
