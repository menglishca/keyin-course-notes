## 1. What is VSCode?
- A lightweight, highly customizable code editor developed by Microsoft.
- Cross-platform: available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Supports a wide variety of programming languages (not just JavaScript!).

## 2. Key Features
- **IntelliSense**: Autocompletion for code, including variables, functions, and keywords.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Run terminal commands directly inside the editor.
- **Built-in Git**: VSCode has Git commands built in, making version control more accessible.
- **Extensions**: Thousands of extensions are available to extend functionality (linting, theming, etc.).
- **Debugging**: Built-in support for debugging Node.js and other languages.
- **Live Share**: Collaborate with others in real time by sharing your editor session.

## 3. Extensions (Making VSCode More Powerful)
- **Popular Extensions for JavaScript/Node.js**:
  - **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting.
  - **ESLint**: For catching and fixing JavaScript errors.
  - **GitLens**: Enhances the built-in Git capabilities.
  - **npm**: Automatically runs npm commands and scripts.
  - **Debugger for Node.js**: Adds advanced debugging features.

## 4. Customizing VSCode
- **Themes**: Change the look and feel with themes (light and dark themes).
- **Settings**: Customize the editorâ€™s behavior (auto-save, tab size, font, etc.).
  - Access through `File > Preferences > Settings`.
  - Or modify settings directly via `settings.json`.
- **Keybindings**: Customize shortcuts or use built-in ones like `Ctrl+P` to open files quickly.

## 5. Working with Git in VSCode
- **Source Control View**:
  - Stage and commit files directly from the editor.
  - View diffs to see changes you've made.
  - Pull and push changes to GitHub from within VSCode.

## 6. Debugging with VSCode
- **Setting Breakpoints**: Pause your code at specific points for debugging.
- **Watch Variables**: Monitor specific variables while your code runs.
- **Step Through Code**: Navigate line by line to see how your code executes.
- **Debug Console**: Run commands and view logs during debugging.

## 7. Useful Tips and Tricks
- **Multiple Cursors**: Edit multiple lines at once with `Alt+Click`.
- **Zen Mode**: Hide everything but the code with `Ctrl+K Z` for a distraction-free experience.
- **Split Editor**: Work with multiple files side by side by dragging tabs.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Launch VSCode directly from the terminal using `code .` in a project folder.
