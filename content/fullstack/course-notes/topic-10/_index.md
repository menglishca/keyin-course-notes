For our tenth topic in fullstack we'll be covering how to connect something like a React frontend to an express backend. In particular, we'll cover:
1. What is frontend development?
1. A brief React review
1. How do React apps work?
1. Monolithic vs Split Server Architecture
1. Examples

It's worth noting that while we'll be focusing on React, these principles apply to any front-end framework and not just React.
