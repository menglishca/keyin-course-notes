## What is Frontend Development?

- **Frontend development** is the process of building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application.
- Front end focuses on, and really only works with, the parts of the application that users interact directly
- This includes:
  - Layout and structure of the page (usually done with HTML)
  - Styling and visual design (usually done with CSS)
  - Interactivity and dynamic behavior (usually done with Javascript)

## What Do You Do as a Frontend Developer?
- Design responsive and accessible interfaces
- Write code that handles user interactions
  - Like clicking buttons, submitting forms, animating things on the page, etc.
- Fetching and displaying data from a server
- Managing **client-side routing** (i.e. navigating between pages without refreshing), if applicable

### Modern Frontend Development
- In modern web apps, frontend code often uses **JavaScript frameworks** like:
  - **React** (our focus)
  - Vue.js
  - Angular
- These frameworks help manage complex UI logic and state
- They make it easier for developers to design interactive websites with tools like components, virtual DOM, and reusable logic

### Frontend + Backend
- The frontend does **not** manage or store persistent data on its own
- It **communicates with a backend server** to:
  - Fetch data to display (e.g. products, user info)
  - Submit data (e.g. forms, logins, file uploads)
- This communication is usually done via **HTTP requests to an API**
