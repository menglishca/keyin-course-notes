## What is Frontend Development?

- **Frontend development** is the process of building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application.
- It focuses on the parts of the application that users interact with directly in the browser.
- This includes:
  - Layout and structure of the page (HTML)
  - Styling and visual design (CSS)
  - Interactivity and dynamic behavior (JavaScript)

## Responsibilities of a Frontend Developer
- Designing responsive and accessible interfaces
- Writing code that handles user interactions (clicks, form submissions, animations, etc.)
- Fetching and displaying data from a server (usually via APIs)
- Managing client-side routing (e.g., navigating between pages without refreshing)

## Core Technologies
- **HTML** – Describes the structure of the page
- **CSS** – Controls the look and layout of the page
- **JavaScript** – Makes the page interactive and dynamic

### Modern Frontend Development
- In modern web apps, frontend code often uses **JavaScript frameworks** like:
  - **React** (our focus)
  - Vue.js
  - Angular
- These frameworks help manage complex UI logic and state
- They also improve developer productivity with tools like components, virtual DOM, and reusable logic

### Frontend + Backend
- The frontend does **not** manage or store data on its own
- It **communicates with a backend server** to:
  - Fetch data to display (e.g. products, user info)
  - Submit data (e.g. forms, logins, file uploads)
- This communication is usually done via **HTTP requests to an API**
