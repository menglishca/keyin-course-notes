## What is SSO?
- Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication method that allows a user to log in once and gain access to multiple applications or services without needing to log in again for each one.
- The main idea is that a user’s authentication credentials are managed centrally and shared across systems.  

## Why Use SSO?
1. **Convenience for Users**:  
   - No need to remember multiple passwords for different systems.  
   - Faster access across services.  
2. **Enhanced Security**:  
   - Reduces password fatigue, lowering the risk of weak or reused passwords.  
   - Centralized authentication can implement strong security measures like MFA.  
3. **Simplified IT Management**:  
   - Fewer password reset requests.  
   - Centralized control over user access.  
4. **Improved User Experience**:  
   - Seamless navigation across integrated systems.  

## Example: SSO in Action
- **Scenario**: A company uses multiple tools for its employees: an email system, a project management tool, and a time tracking app.  

1. **Without SSO**:  
   - Employees log in separately to each tool with different credentials.  
   - They have to remember multiple usernames and passwords.  
2. **With SSO**:  
   - Employees log in once through the company’s IdP.  
   - The same login gives them access to all tools without further authentication.
   - This streamlines both security and user experience, making SSO a powerful tool for modern applications.
