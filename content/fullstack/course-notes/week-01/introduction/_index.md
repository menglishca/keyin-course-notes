- Developers tend to optimize tasks to make life easier and work faster.
- Writing code manually was error-prone, leading to the creation of **IDEs** to streamline writing, testing, and debugging.
- Switching between multiple IDEs was inefficient, so tools like **VSCode** emergedâ€”lightweight editors with powerful extensions.
- Collaborating on code was difficult, so **version control systems** like **Git** were created to manage changes and teamwork.
- Sharing code across teams and the world required a solution, leading to platforms like **GitHub** for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on code.
- Mastering these toolsâ€”VSCode, Git, and GitHubâ€”improves productivity, collaboration, and code reliability.

  <summary>ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact: Git isnâ€™t the only version control system!</summary>

  - **Git** is the most popular version control system today, but it's not the only one.
  - **Subversion (SVN)**: An older version control system that's still used in some legacy projects. It's centralized, meaning all code is stored on a central server.
  - **Mercurial**: Similar to Git, but with a simpler interface. Itâ€™s another distributed version control system, but it's less commonly used.
  - Other systems include **Perforce** and **Bazaar**, though they are less widely adopted in modern development.

  Git's popularity comes from its speed, flexibility, and strong community support, but depending on the project or team, other systems can still be used.
