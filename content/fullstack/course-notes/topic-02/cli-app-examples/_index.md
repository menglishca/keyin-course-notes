title: 5. Extra CLI Application Examples
cascade:
  type: docs
---

Programming is very much an applied skill, and the general consensus is that the best way to learn to code is to write code. So we'll cover some more examples to hopefully do just that. We'll focus on making various CLI applications and showcase how you would expand upon them with proper git practices.

## Notes
- A focus should be made to practice good git hygiene during these examples
    - This means: small, meaningful commits that describe what is being done
- New features should be added on a separate branch and then merged in via a github pull request
- Make sure good code formatting is followed
